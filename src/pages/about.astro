    Warnock Cabinetry started with a desire to make unique and impactful
    furnishings. From there, we expanded to custom closets, built-in cabinetry
    and now offer complete kitchen remodeling. Our pieces are meant to be an
    integral part of your daily living experienceâ€”something to appreciate and
    enrich your space. In every aspect, we proudly carry the essence of the
    Gatineau hills in our custom cabinetry.
